# DSA4264_Geospatial_Find_Redundant_Bus_Services
This project deals with geospatial Bus and MRT data taken from Datamall. In 2023, bus service 167 was deemed to be running parallel to the TEC MRT line, a sign of inefficiency. See:

What other bus services have a similar issue? That is our task. A summary of the project scope is given to us by our lecturer, and can be found in the repository.

This project is an assignment from a NUS course - DSA4264: Sense-making Case Analysis: Public Policy and Society, taught by lecturer Mr. Shaun Khoo.
